    "What was your biggest challenge in this project? (regarding writing code and not only)\n",
    "\n",
    "The biggest challenge is to understand K-means. It took me quite a while to read through the file and understand the concept. I was quite confused at begining why the accuracy number is different each time I ran. I will remember to set up random_state to make my results reproducible. \n",
    "\n",
    "What did you learn while working on this project? (regarding writing code and not only)\n",
    "\n",
    "I noticed that the KMeans method is acturally very common used. In my own single cell analysis, the k-mean is widely used to cluster cells and generate UMAP plot.I was not fully aware of it until I read through the kmean document from this project. \n",
    "When seperating train and test datasets, I was thinking to manually seperate half dataset for train dataset and half for test dataset, however, my group member used  sklearn.model_selection train_test_split function. Very smart. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If you had more time on the project what other question(s) would you like to answer? (at least one question is required)\n",
    "\n",
    "I would like to compare the three accuracy numbers and investigate why I got the highest accuracy score at the train dataset and why the accuracy scores have this trend in the three tests? What can be possibly done to improve the accuracy score (from both sample collections and fitting to approprate model point of views)?\n",

    "The biggest coding challenge was wrapping my head around the structure of the GEOParse object and making sure I was getting the correct pieces out of it. \n",
    "\n",
    "What did you learn while working on this project? (regarding writing code and not only)\n",
    "\n",
    "I learned that sklearn designates its own internal state for reproducibility rather than depending on the environment for the seed. That had not been my experience with similar tools in R or Python so it was good to know. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you had more time on the project what other question(s) would you like to answer? (at least one question is required)\n",

    "I'd like to ask if a consensus model of some kind could be generated by training the model with thirds of the data and combining the results in some meaningful way. Then of course I'd like to know how that stacks up against other methods.\n"
